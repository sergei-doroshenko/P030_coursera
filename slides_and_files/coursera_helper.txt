Enroll:
I'm currently have only part-time work and, because I have to rent an apartment, I'm very short of money. 
I have an intention to work in bioinformatic and to help people be more healthy, so in my opinion this course will help me to achieve this aim.
I'm going to take active part in classes and program assignment discussions, in order to help others to pass this course.
